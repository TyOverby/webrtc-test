webrtc-test
===========

A test of the peerjs-browserify npm package.

The demo is dumb, it just synchronises two slider bars on a page.  

Take a look at package.json to see how to use peer.js from npm. 
Take a look at the first 5 lines of main.js to see how to use the package.

Run build.sh to compile main.js using browserify.
